		Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Ukraine represents a pivotal moment in India’s foreign policy, suggesting a significant recalibration of New Delhi’s relationship with Kyiv and a potential downturn in its long-standing ties with Moscow. The optics of Modi’s engagement with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy—marked by gestures of camaraderie and dialogue and the image of Modi placing a reassuring hand on Zelenskyy’s shoulder — signal a noticeable shift towards Ukraine and its NATO-mentored policies in the region. This embrace of Ukraine will raise questions about the implications for India’s strategic autonomy and whether India will be subjected to what former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described (disapprovingly), in a recent article in ‘Foreign Affairs’, as “loyalty tests” by the US in the future. 
		<br>
		Strategic flexibility has defined India’s foreign policy, especially in recent years. Historically, India has relied on Russia as a strategic partner, a relationship built on shared geopolitical interests and a track record of being a reliable partner. However, the world is changing, and Modi’s visit seems to suggest that India is ready to embrace a more western-aligned stance, particularly in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

		Contrarians may question the motivations behind this new alignment. Other than personal chemistry, a deeper strategic calculus appears to have played a significant role in Modi’s decision to engage more closely with Ukraine. The chemistry between Modi and Zelenskyy is palpable (although the Ukrainian President’s Musharraf-like ‘press meet’ with Indian journalists bordered on the distasteful), but it is accompanied by a strategic imperative: the need for India to enhance its global standing and assert its influence in an increasingly multipolar world. The question remains—at what cost? A defining moment in this recalibration came last July, when Modi met with Vladimir Putin in Moscow. The Russian decision to bomb a children’s hospital in Ukraine around that period offended India. However, there was a reluctance, despite Modi’s personal hurt expressed in no uncertain terms to Putin, to directly confront Russia while simultaneously recognising the moral implications of its actions. The dichotomy in India’s response highlighted the complexities of its diplomatic stance and the inherent tensions in its relationships with both Russia and the West. But this seems to have now changed.
