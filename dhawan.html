		There was always an ase to the manner in which Shikhar Dhawan conducted himself, be it on or off the field. If fluidity in batting deined his forays to the crease, the southpaw always exuded a friendly vibe in the public space. Easy to laugh and equally quick to do a bhangra with his team-mates in the dressing room, effervescence was Dhawanâ€™s essential trait. At 38, the former India opener, and one, who sporadically captained the Men in Blue in limited overs cricket, bowed out of the willow game. Through a video he posted on his social media handles, Dhawan announced his retirement on Saturday morning. Even in this he was media-friendly, giving ample time for correspondents to chew on their thoughts and give expression to their reactions.

		Strangely, Dhawan, the lord of runs in the shorter formats, suffered a dull start with a duck on his ODI debut against the Aussies at Visakhapatnam in 2010. Before that game, skipper M.S. Dhoni spoke about how he and Dhawan had come through the rungs and that the opener deserved his opportunities. In Tests however, Dhawan reversed the trend, hammering a 187 against the Aussies during his debut at Mohali in 2013. The post-hundred celebrations were effusive batraised, slapping his thighs like a kabaddi player or wrestler, and an instant connect with the public was established.
